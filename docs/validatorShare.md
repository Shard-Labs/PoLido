# ValidatorShare Contract
When a user requests withdrawal, the validatorShare contract transfers the total rewards accumulated automatically. The same thing happens when buying new vouchers. **So the idea is to consider all the tokens that are not submitted using submit function as rewards, and they should be distributed.**
The same thing happens with buyVoucher, and sellVoucher_new.
